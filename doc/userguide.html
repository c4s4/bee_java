<p>This file is the reference documentation for the Java Bee package.
This package is made of tasks to build your Java projects and templates
to quick start new ones.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Bee packages are managed as Ruby Gems, thus you can install Bee Java
typing <tt>sudo gem install bee_java</tt> under Unix systems or <tt>gem 
install bee_java</tt> under Windows. Note that this will also install Bee
if not already installed because Bee is a required dependency of 
<i>bee_java</i>.</p>

<h2>Java Tasks</h2>

<p>To get a reference about Java tasks, please see 
<a href="tasksreference.html">Tasks Reference</a> section.</p>

<p>You can also get documentation about a given task in a terminal typing
<tt>bee -k java.jar</tt> for instance. To list all available tasks in the
Java package, type <tt>bee -k java.?</tt>.</p>

<h2>Java Templates</h2>

<p>To get a reference about Java templates, please see 
<a href="templatesreference.html">Templates Reference</a> section.</p>

<p>You can also get documentation about a given template in a terminal typing
<tt>bee -e java.lib</tt> for instance. To list all available templates in the
Java package, type <tt>bee -e java.?</tt>.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>This package comes with tools to convert dependencies file from and to maven
project files.</p>

<h3>gendeps</h3>

<p>This tools generates a Bee dependencies file for existing Maven 2 project.
To do so, type following command line in the root directory of the project:</p>

<pre>
gendeps > dependencies.yml
</pre>

<p>To generate this file, the tool runs Maven to get the list of dependencies
using the command <tt>mvn dependency:list</tt> and parse result. The scope
of Maven dependencies is converted into Bee scope with the following table:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Maven Scope</th><th>Bee Scopes</th></tr>
<tr><td>compile</td><td>compile, test, runtime</td></tr>
<tr><td>provided</td><td>compile, test</td></tr>
<tr><td>runtime</td><td>test, runtime</td></tr>
<tr><td>test</td><td>test</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Dependencies are searched recursively, thus generated list might be quite
big as it includes all dependencies that will be included in CLASSPATH. You
should check for collisions in this list as this is a quite common issue in
the case of recursive dependencies.</p>

<h3>maven2bee</h3>

<p>This script converts a Maven (1 or 2) POM file into a Bee dependencies file.
Dependencies are not searched recursively, thus you should prefer using the
tool <tt>gendeps</tt> for Maven 2 projects. Maven scope is converted with the
same table than with the <tt>gendeps</tt> tool.</p>

<p>To convert a Maven 1 project file you would type:</p>

<pre>
maven2bee project.xml > dependencies.yml
</pre>

<h3>bee2maven</h3>

<p>This script converts a Bee dependencies file into a Maven POM file (for the
part related to dependencies). Note that it doesn't manage scopes and that
you should manage them by hand in generated file.</p>

<p>To convert a Bee dependencies file into a Maven POM, type:</p>

<pre>
bee2maven dependencies.yml > project.xml
</pre>

<p><i>Enjoy!</i></p>
